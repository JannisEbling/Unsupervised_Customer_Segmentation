# Customer Personality Analyis

In this project, I will analyze customer records from a grocery firm's database. Additionally, I will use an unsupervised clustering algorithm to segment the customers into clusters based on their similarities. This analysis can help the company understand the needs and behaviors of distinct customer groups, allowing them to target specific groups more effectively, grow market share, and increase profit.

The dataset together with a detailed description of all the features can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis
